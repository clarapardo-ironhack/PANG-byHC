This project was done in just **1 week** as part of our web development Bootcamp assignments at **Ironhack**. 
*Requirements:* create an arcade videogame just using Canvas in HTML, as well as JavaScript. 

We decided to modernize the classic *PANG*, with a more minimalist approach and neon decorations to add some color.
