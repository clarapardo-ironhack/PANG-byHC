This project was done in just **1 week** as part of our web development Bootcamp assignments at **Ironhack**. 
*Requirements:* create an arcade videogame just using Canvas in HTML, as well as JavaScript. 

We decided to modernize the classic *PANG*, with a more minimalist approach and neon decorations to add some color.

### About the game

To win this single-level game, you have to reduce and eliminate all the bubbles bouncing around the screen. To help you, extra lives appear on top of the platform every now and then.
